# US-county-shootings

Used the following files:
1) Slate Gun Deaths(SGD) csv file.
2) us-county-names as a translation map to turn the SGD counties into county IDs (see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4090846)

- Created a frequency map of county shootings and displayed this data on a map of US counties.
- Used colorbrewer2.org to get some nicer color codes for your visualization. 
- Added some interaction: clicking on a marker should show additional information etc.
